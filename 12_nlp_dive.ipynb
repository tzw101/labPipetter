        "In practice, creating accurate models from this kind of RNN is difficult. We will get better results if we call `detach` less often, and have more layers—this gives our RNN a longer time horizon to learn from, and richer features to create. But it also means we have a deeper model to train. The key challenge in the development of deep learning has been figuring out how to train these kinds of models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason this is challenging is because of what happens when you multiply by a matrix many times. Think about what happens when you multiply by a number many times. For example, if you multiply by 2, starting at 1, you get the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8,... after 32 steps you are already at 4,294,967,296. A similar issue happens if you multiply by 0.5: you get 0.5, 0.25, 0.125… and after 32 steps it's 0.00000000023. As you can see, multiplying by a number even slightly higher or lower than 1 results in an explosion or disappearance of our starting number, after just a few repeated multiplications.\n",

        "Because matrix multiplication is just multiplying numbers and adding them up, exactly the same thing happens with repeated matrix multiplications. And that's all a deep neural network is —each extra layer is another matrix multiplication. This means that it is very easy for a deep neural network to end up with extremely large or extremely small numbers.\n",

        "This is a problem, because the way computers store numbers (known as \"floating point\") means that they become less and less accurate the further away the numbers get from zero. The diagram in <<float_prec>>, from the excellent article [\"What You Never Wanted to Know About Floating Point but Will Be Forced to Find Out\"](http://www.volkerschatz.com/science/float.html), shows how the precision of floating-point numbers varies over the number line."

Another strategy for dealing with this is by being careful about initialization, which is a topic we'll investigate in <<chapter_foundations>>.\n",

Its mathematical expression can be written like this:\n",

What goes out on the right is the new hidden state ($h_{t}$) and new cell state ($c_{t}$), ready for our next input. The new hidden state is also used as output, which is why the arrow splits to go up.\n",

        "First, the arrows for input and old hidden state are joined together. In the RNN we wrote earlier in this chapter, we were adding them together. In the LSTM, we stack them in one big tensor. This means the dimension of our embeddings (which is the dimension of $x_{t}$) can be different than the dimension of our hidden state. If we call those `n_in` and `n_hid`, the arrow at the bottom is of size `n_in + n_hid`; thus all the neural nets (orange boxes) are linear layers with `n_in + n_hid` inputs and `n_hid` outputs.\n",

We multiply this result by the cell state to determine which information to keep and which to throw away: values closer to 0 are discarded and values closer to 1 are kept. This gives the LSTM the ability to forget things about its long-term state. For instance, when crossing a period or an `xxbos` token, we would expect to it to (have learned to) reset its cell state.\n",

For instance, we may see a new gender pronoun, in which case we'll need to replace the information about gender that the forget gate removed. Similar to the forget gate, the input gate decides which elements of the cell state to update (values close to 1) or not (values close to 0). The third gate determines what those updated values are, in the range of –1 to 1 (thanks to the tanh function). The result is then added to the cell state.\n",

Using LSTM (or GRU) cells makes training easier than with vanilla RNNs, but they are still very prone to overfitting. Data augmentation, while a possibility, is less often used for text data than for images because in most cases it requires another model to generate random augmentations (e.g., by translating the text into another language and then back into the original language). Overall, data augmentation for text data is currently not a well-explored space.\n",

This paper showed how effective use of *dropout*, *activation regularization*, and *temporal activation regularization* could allow an LSTM to beat state-of-the-art results that previously required much more complicated models. The authors called an LSTM using these techniques an *AWD-LSTM*. We'll look at each of these techniques in turn."

        "> note: Do Your Own Experiments: In previous chapters of the book we'd be adding a code example for `bernoulli_` here, so you can see exactly how it works. But now that you know enough to do this yourself, we're going to be doing fewer and fewer examples for you, and instead expecting you to do your own experiments to see how things work. In this case, you'll see in the end-of-chapter questionnaire that we're asking you to experiment with `bernoulli_`—but don't wait for us to ask you to experiment to develop your understanding of the code we're studying; go ahead and do it anyway!\n",

Dropout is also used in many other models, including the default CNN head used in `fastai.vision`, and is available in `fastai.tabular` by passing the `ps` parameter (where each \"p\" is passed to each added `Dropout` layer), as we'll see in <<chapter_arch_details>>."

That means it's likely that the outputs of our LSTMs should somewhat make sense when we read them in order. TAR is there to encourage that behavior by adding a penalty to the loss to make the difference between two consecutive activations as small as possible: our activations tensor has a shape `bs x sl x n_hid`, and we read consecutive activations on the sequence length axis (the dimension in the middle). With this, TAR can be expressed as:\n",

To make this work, we need our model with dropout to return three things: the proper output, the activations of the LSTM pre-dropout, and the activations of the LSTM post-dropout. AR is often applied on the dropped-out activations (to not penalize the activations we turned into zeros afterward) while TAR is applied on the non-dropped-out activations (because those zeros create big differences between two consecutive time steps). There is then a callback called `RNNRegularizer` that will apply this regularization for us."

Since fine-tuning those five dropout values (including the dropout before the output layer) is complicated, we have determined good defaults and allow the magnitude of dropout to be tuned overall with the `drop_mult` parameter you saw in that chapter (which is multiplied by each dropout).\n",
